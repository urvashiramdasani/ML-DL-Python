Competitve neural networks are those in which there is only one output neuron is active at a time.
Output neurons are interconnected. These connections are called Lateral or inhibitory connections.
Connection from input to put are called feedforward connection or excitatory.
weight vectors of winning vector approach the input vector with learning.
