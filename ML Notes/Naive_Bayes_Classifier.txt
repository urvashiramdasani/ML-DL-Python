1) These are statistical classifiers, which use Bayes Theorem to calculate probabilities. 

2) Let X be a data sample and H be the hypotheses that X belongs to a class. 
  P(X) - evidence, P(H|X) - posteriori probablity, P(H) - prior probability, P(X|H) - likelihood

  posteriori = likelihood * prior / evidence
  
3) Computationally costly.
