## Simple Linear Regression
1) Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables.  It looks for statistical relationship but not deterministic relationship. Relationship between two variables is said to be deterministic if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other. 

2) Gradient Descent - Partial derivative of the cost function with respect to the parameter can give optimal co-efficient value. 

3) Residual Analysis - Randomness and unpredictability are the two main components of a regression model. 
Prediction = Deterministic + Stochastic

Residual Analysis helps us to find out how bad the model is behaving. Plot the residual plot to find whether the predictions was high, low or equal. Residuals do not exhibit any pattern. If there is a pattern that means some variable is missed which is making significant contribution. 

4) Metrics for Model Evaluation
  a. R-squared error - Range 0 to 1. If it is negative, then regression line is forcefully passed through a point. 
    i. Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) - Error = sum((predicted output - average of actual output)^2)
    ii. Sum Squared Error (SSE) -  Error = sum((predicted output - actual output)^2)
    iii. Total Sum of Squares (SSTO) -  Error = sum((actual output - average of actual output)^2)
    
    R^2 = 1 - (SSE/SSTO)
    
  b. Correlation Coefficient - +- sqrt(R^2)
    If slope is negative, it is negative else positive. Range -1 to 1.
