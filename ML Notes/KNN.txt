K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions).

Distance functions are Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski. These should be chose when the variable is continuous. When there are categorical variables present, 
Hamming Distance should be used. 

Cross Validation is a way to determine the value of K. Optimal values of K are between 3 - 10.

The error rate at K=1 is always zero for the training sample. This is because the closest point to any training data point is itself.
Hence the prediction is always accurate with K=1.

To get the optimal value of K, you can segregate the training and validation from the initial dataset. 
Now plot the validation error curve to get the optimal value of K. This value of K should be used for all predictions.

In KNN Regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbours.

kNN is a type of instance based learning or lazy learning. Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the contributions of the
neighbours, so that the nearer neighbours contribute more to the average than more distant ones. 

Thumb rule is k = sqrt(n), where n is the number of training samples. k value should be odd. k value should not be multiple of the number of classes. 
It should not be too small(greater influence of noise) or too large(biased towards highly probable classes)
