Unsupervised learning algorithm.  it is used as a process to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings inherent in a set of examples.

-> Clustering has applications in Market segmentation, social network analysis, organize computing clutsers, astronomical data analysis.

-> this will give us insight into underlying patterns of different groups.

-> Clustering is also used to reduce the dimensionality of the data when you are dealing with a copious number of variables.

-> Treat outliers before calculating distance. Standardize variables. 

1. k-means - k = number of clusters
-> Assign each data point to a cluster using euclidean distance between centroid and data point. Calculate the new centroid. Repeat until no changes occur.

-> Elbow method is used to decide the optimal number of clusters (k). Plot the sum squared error with values of k to find optimal k.

-> Similarity measure is the distance between data points.

2. Hierarchial - Assign all data points a cluster. It combines two nearest data points into one cluster.
